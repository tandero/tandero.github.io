We live in a modern world! I'm not going to update this website whenever I publish something!

Find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3xIkXusAAAAJ) or [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas_Anderson10) or [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2387-5219). 

If you don't have access and want a copy, [email me](mailto:thomas.anderson@radlab.zone) and I'll send it to you. 

If you don't want to get in touch personally, you can circumvent the barriers with [sci-hub](https://wadauk.github.io/scihub_ck/index.html).

Let technology work for you!
