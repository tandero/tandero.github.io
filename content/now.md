### What do I do right now?

<!-- <img align="right" width="300" height="300" src="../attachments/Icon.jpg"> Comment --> 

I'm finishing my PhD at the University of Toronto. I had been aiming to graduate August 2020, but COVID has delayed me to August 2021.  

I study meta-awareness and attention for my primary PhD work. See my [about page](../about) for more on that.  
I also study [psychedelic microdosing](https://psychedelicscience.ca) and published some of the first research on the topic. We are submitting a Clinical Trial Application to Health Canada to run research on microdosing psilocybin. I consult for [Cybin](https://cybin.com), a biotech company focused on psychedelics therapeutics.

I did [a podcast](https://anchor.fm/tick-talk/episodes/Thomas-Anderson-Meditation--Science-and-Psychedelics-ea20jm) in December 2019 where I talk about microdosing and meditation, another area of my research.
