### What do I do right now?

<!-- <img align="right" width="300" height="300" src="../attachments/Icon.jpg"> Comment --> 

I'm finishing my PhD at the University of Toronto. I had been aiming to graduate August 2020, but COVID has delayed me.  

I study meta-awareness and attention for my primary PhD work. See my [about page](../about) for more on that.  
I also study psychedelics and have published some of the [first research on psychedelic microdosing](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-019-0308-4) (more [here](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Microdosing-Psychedelics)). I co-founded the [Psychedelic Studies Research Program](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/psychedelics/)at the University of Toronto and we submitted a Clinical Trial Application to Health Canada to run research on psilocybin microdosing. I also co-founded the [Canadian Centre for Psychedelic Science](https://psychedelicscience.ca) as a firm to consult with industry partners. 

I did [a podcast](https://anchor.fm/tick-talk/episodes/Thomas-Anderson-Meditation--Science-and-Psychedelics-ea20jm) in December 2019 where I talk about microdosing and about meditation, another area of my research and the topic of my Master's thesis.
