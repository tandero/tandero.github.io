### What do I do right now?

I am currently on medical leave.  
I recently published an online book of [career advice for academic psychology](https://my-digital-garden-thomasandersonscience.vercel.app/).  

Prior to my medical leave, I achieved candiacy in my PhD at the University of Toronto. As a PhD Candidate, all I have left is writing and defending my dissertation.  

My PhD research focuses on meta-awareness and attention. See my [about page](../about) for more on that.  

I also study psychedelics. I published some of the [first research on psychedelic microdosing](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-019-0308-4) and our team recently finished the first Canadian Clinical Trial on psilocybin microdosing. I co-founded the [Canadian Centre for Psychedelic Science](https://psychedelicscience.ca) with [Rotem Petranker](https://petranker.com). I also co-founded the [Psychedelic Studies Research Program](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/psychedelics/) at the University of Toronto.   

Feel free to reach out or check out [my CV](https://1drv.ms/b/c/d12b959c76deddf6/Qfbd3naclSsggNEwfQAAAAAAl2PoEojby9Yz-g).
