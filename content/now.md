### What do I do right now?

I'm finishing my PhD at the University of Toronto, ambitiously aiming to be done by August 2020 (realistically December 2020). I study meta-awareness and attention for my primary PhD work.  
I also study [psychedelic microdosing](https://psychedelicscience.ca) and we published some of the first research on the topic. We hope to begin our clinical trial in summer 2020.

I did [a podcast](https://anchor.fm/tick-talk/episodes/Thomas-Anderson-Meditation--Science-and-Psychedelics-ea20jm) in December 2019 that's got some background and recent thoughts.
