### What do I do right now?

I'm finishing my PhD at the University of Toronto, ambitiously aiming to be done by August 2020. I study meta-awareness and attention for my primary PhD work.  
I also study [psychedelic microdosing](https://psychedelicscience.ca) and we published some of the first research on the topic. We hope to begin our clinical trial in early 2020.
