### What do I do right now?

<!-- <img align="right" width="300" height="300" src="../attachments/Icon.jpg"> Comment --> 

I'm finishing my PhD at the University of Toronto. I had been ambitiously aiming to graduate August 2020, but with my neuroimaging research on hold due to COVID, my new estimate is wider: December 2020 to August 2021.  

I study meta-awareness and attention for my primary PhD work. See my [about page](../about) for more on that.  
I also study [psychedelic microdosing](https://psychedelicscience.ca) and published some of the first research on the topic. We had hoped to begin our clinical trial in summer 2020; stay tuned. I also consult for a mushroom life-sciences company called [Cybin](https://cybin.com).

I did [a podcast](https://anchor.fm/tick-talk/episodes/Thomas-Anderson-Meditation--Science-and-Psychedelics-ea20jm) in December 2019 that's got some background and recent thoughts.
