### In two words

Meticulous polymath

### In twenty seconds

PhD candidate at the University of Toronto studying meta-awareness and pioneering research on psychedelic microdosing.  
Co-Founder of the [Canadian Centre for Psychedelic Science](https://psychedelicscience.ca) and the [Psychedelic Studies Research Program](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/psychedelics/).  
Additional projects on attention, meditation, wisdom, and creativity. Strong focus on rigour and transparency.  

### In ninety seconds

My PhD research is developing tools to model the neural dynamics of meta-awareness: the moment that we realize we weren't paying attention. Meta-awareness involves noticing that our behaviours are not aligned with our overall goals. For example, we may catch ourselves unintentionally mind-wandering even though our goal is to pay attention to the task at hand. My research involves neuroimaging (fMRI, fNIRS, EEG), physiological, behavioural, and self-report data.  

Additionally, some of my research was among the earliest academic investigations on psychedelic microdosing and our research team performed the first Clinical Trial on psychedelic microdosing approved by Health Canada.
