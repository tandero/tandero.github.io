### In two words

Meticulous polymath

### In twenty seconds

PhD candidate at the University of Toronto studying meta-awareness and attention. Co-Founder of the [Psychedelic Studies Research Program](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/psychedelics/) and [Canadian Centre for Psychedelic Science](https://psychedelicscience.ca) pioneering research on psychedelic microdosing. Side-projects on mediation, creativity, wisdom, and attention. Strong focus on rigour and transparency.

### In ninety seconds

My PhD supervisor is [Prof. Norman Farb](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/psychology/faculty-staff/farb-norman) in the [Regulatory and Affective Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.radlab.zone/). My PhD committee includes [Prof. Michael Inzlicht](http://michaelinzlicht.com/)  (social neuroscientist) and [Prof. Kei Fukuda](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/psychology/faculty-staff/fukuda-keisuke) (cognitive neuroscientist).

I am developing neuroanalytic methods aimed at studying meta-awareness: the moment that we realize that our behaviours are not aligned with our overall goals. The clearest example of this is when we catch ourselves unintentionally mind-wandering even though our goal is to pay attention to the task at hand. 

I collect and analyze self-report, behavioural, physiological, and neuroimaging (MRI, fNIRS, EEG) data. I'm ultimately trying to model how 1.5 kg of fatty brain-tissue consciously experiences a universe, but for now I take baby steps toward answering those big questions. My PhD attempts to develop tools for modelling the neural dynamics of attention and meta-awareness: objectively quantifying the subjective.

I love to collaborate so feel free to [reach out](mailto:thomas.anderson@radlab.zone). Collaboration is a resource-multiplier. I take special  joy in designing [Xanatos gambit](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosGambit) experiments; it is an exercise in reducing inefficiencies and I love it.

### My Personal Life

Not that it's anyone's business, but here are a few things about me. I adore decadence.

* I love dark chocolate, more than 85% and ideally 100%. [Chocosol](https://chocosoltraders.com/collections/shop-now/products/100-gratitude-csbar) is my daily go-to. [Sirene](https://sirenechocolate.com/products/100) is a delight.  
* I eat ethically sourced meat. [Sanagain's Meat Locker](http://www.sanagansmeatlocker.com/) is my butcher of choice.  
* I wear clothing made from natural fibres like cotton, wool, bamboo, or cashmere. I find they breathe better. [Merino wool socks](https://www.greatsox.com/collections/merino) in cold Canadian winters included. I like [United Dry Stock Goods](https://unitedstockdrygoods.com/) for apparel.  
* I order my shoes from [Carmina](https://www.carminashoemaker.com/men-shoes). I've got a great pair of boots from [Dayton](https://www.daytonboots.com/collections/men/products/service-boot).  
* I get custom gloves made by [Chester Jeffries](https://www.chesterjefferies.co.uk/mens-leather-gloves/). My four pairs have served me well.   
* I cut with beautiful knives from [hacher&krain](http://www.hacherandkrain.com/). My choice are the K-Sabatier Authentique 1834 Ltd.  
* I [don't use social media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMotykw0SIk&t=21m22s) (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.). I use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead of Google. I use [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/).
